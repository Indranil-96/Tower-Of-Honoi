# Tower-Of-Honoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one rod to another, following certain rules. The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The rules are simple:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with ( n ) disks is ( 2^n - 1 ). This puzzle has been used in computer science to illustrate principles of recursion and algorithmic problem-solving.
